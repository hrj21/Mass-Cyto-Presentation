## What are the goals of our analysis? 
![hmm](img/hmm_a5viI92PAF89q.gif)

- Identify all cell types present in the sample
- Compare population frequencies between samples
- Compare antigen expression between samples
- Track cell development pathways
- Characterise functional state of populations

## What are the challenges presented by mass cytometry data?
![why+is+it+so+hard+crying](img/why+is+it+so+hard+crying_bSMLyLCwmoNeizLZqY.gif)

- More parameters than conventional flow cytometry
- Visualising patterns in the data is difficult
- Manual gating is difficult to impossible (2^p^ bivariate combinations)
- We turn to machine learning techniques instead

<small> We turn to machine learning techniques instead to do the work for us, but these techniques can perform poorly due to the *curse of dimensionality* </small>
