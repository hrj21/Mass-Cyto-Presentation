.vlarge[But these techniques can perform poorly when the number of parameters is high. This is due to a phenomenon known as **the curse of dimensionality**.]

# The curse of dimensionality
<center>
<div>
<img src="img/Curse_of_dimensionality.png" height = 300>
</div>
</center>

--

- Algorithms that rely on calculating the **distance** between points, suffer in high-dimensional space

--

- In high dimensions most of the "volume" of the **feature space** is empty, or **sparse**

--

- Algorithms are more likely to start learning from noise in the data, rather than signal

--

- Distance also starts to lose its meaning

# Common dimension reduction algorithms

--

- **Principal components analysis**

    - Linear dimension reduction
    - The first few PCs explain most of the variation in the data, the rest can be discarded
    - Usually performs poorly for flow cytometry data
--
- **t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)**

    - Non-linear dimension reduction
    - Computationally expensive
    - Works well for flow cytometry data
--
- **Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)**

    - Non-linear dimension reduction
    - Not as computationally expensive
    - Works well for flow cytometry data

# Hyperparameters of t-SNE

The t-SNE algorithm has **hyperparameters** that control what the final embedding looks like:

- perplexity &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (emphasis on global vs local structure)
- theta &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (0 -> 1 increases speed but decreases accuracy)
- eta &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (learning rate, default value usually fine)
- n iterations / epochs &emsp; (must be high enough to converge)

## t-SNE

- Preserves local structure but not global structure
- Computationally expensive

- Islands of points tend to be more globular

## UMAP
